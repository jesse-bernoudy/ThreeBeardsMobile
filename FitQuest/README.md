# FitQuest

FitQuest will take advantage of the FitBit REST api to provide an easy to read, at-a-glance visualization of the users daily progress. The visualization will be a character sprite moving along a themed background, turning a users FitBit progress into an idle-style game. The app will require the use of FitBit's REST api as well as the RetroFit Android api to adapt the REST calls to the Android ecosystem. The app will also require a function to launch the FitBit app, in the case the user manually syncs their FitBit data. This app will be targetted at game enthusiasts who are looking for something extra to add a little fun into their personal health care as well as anyopne else looking for a more interesting display of their daily progress.

Use Case:
As a lazy gamer, I don't care if my FitBit app shows me numbers as much as I care that my game character advances throughout a level, making me more likely to move around a bit to make progress in the game.
